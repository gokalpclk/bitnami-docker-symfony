# Bitnami Symfony Development Container

## TL;DR

### Local workspace

```console
$ mkdir ~/my-project
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up
```

**Warning**: This quick setup is only intended for development environments. You are encouraged to change the insecure default credentials and check out the available configuration options for the [MariaDB container](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#readme) for a more secure deployment.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

## Introduction

[Symfony](https://symfony.com/), is a web application framework written in [PHP](http://www.php.net) under [MIT License](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/license.html).

The Bitnami Symfony Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Symfony development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Symfony Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Symfony Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Symfony application:

```console
$ mkdir ~/my-project
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml) file:

```console
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Choose the skeleton you want to use to create your project. By default this image ships two skeletons:

- `symfony/skeleton`: useful for microservices or API(s).
- `symfony/website-skeleton`: useful for traditional web applications.

You can use the `SYMFONY_PROJECT_SKELETON` env. variable to choose the skeleton to use. Find more information about available skeletons [at the Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html#creating-symfony-applications).

You can also configure your Symfony app to use a database. As an alternative, you can also set `SYMFONY_SKIP_DATABASE` to `true` to skip the database configuration.
The example below shows how to set the required env. vars to do use a MariaDB container as database:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: bitnami/mariadb:10.3
    environment:
      # ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD is recommended only for development.
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MARIADB_USER=bn_myapp
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_myapp
  myapp:
    image: bitnami/symfony:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    environment:
      # ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD is recommended only for development.
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - SYMFONY_PROJECT_SKELETON=symfony/website-skeleton
      - SYMFONY_DATABASE_HOST=mariadb
      - SYMFONY_DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - SYMFONY_DATABASE_USER=bn_myapp
      - SYMFONY_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_myapp
    volumes:
      - './my-project:/app'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
```

Finally launch the Symfony application development environment using:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

The above command creates a container service for Symfony development and bootstraps a new Symfony application, in the "my-project" subdirectory under your working directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

After the built-in PHP application server has been started, visit http://localhost:8000 in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the Symfony welcome page.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Symfony Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```console
$ docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```

where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

For instance, follow the example below to install a custom Symfony pack in your app:

```console
$ docker-compose run myapp composer require SYMFONY_PACK -d /app
```

> Note: remember to replace the _SYMFONY_PACK_ placeholder with the actual pack you want to install.

## Notable Changes

### 4.4.30-debian-10-r0 and 5.3.7-debian-10-r0

- The size of the container image has been decreased.
- The configuration logic is now based on Bash scripts in the *rootfs/* folder.
- The `symfony` cli is not included in the container anymore, use `composer` to install Symfony packs instead.
